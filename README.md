Instructions on Assessment: The module assessment comprises of an INDIVIDUAL research-based assignment that requires you to   write an essay that represents 100% of the module mark. You are required to produce a report   covering   all four tasks of the assessment. Focussing   on   a   company   of your   choice that   has   some   international   presence,   and   assuming that the   company   is   considering   further   international   expansion   into   new   countries,   conduct   a   research-based   strategic analysis addressing the following tasks.
1)       Applying the CAGE framework, identify similarities/differences between the home country of   the   company   and   two   potential   host   countries   (each   in   two   continents   that   are   different   from   the   home       country       of       the       company).       Discuss       the       strategic       implications         of       those         CAGE   similarities/differences,   and   recommend one of the two   countries for   the   company   to   invest   in.   (30 marks, 900 words   maximum)
2)       Using    Porter’s      National      Diamond      (PND)      framework,      evaluate      the      competitiveness      of      the   recommended   country   focusing   on   the   relevant   industry   the   company   is   interested   in,   and   summarise the strategic implications of the findings from the PND analysis for the company (25   marks, 750 words maximum)
3)       Based    on    the    findings    of   the    above   analyses,    identify   what    should    be   the      relatively    most   important strategy out of the AAA (Adaptation, Aggregation or Arbitrage) strategies to focus   on for the company to create value in the recommended   host country   to   start with,   and   justify   your   recommendation.   Reflect   on   how   this   strategy   may   shift   over   time   as   the   firm   continues   to   operate in the recommended   country. (25   marks,   750 words   maximum)
4)       Drawing    on    the   above   analyses   and   supported   with   other   relevant   sources,   briefly   discuss   THREE   cross-border   challenges    in   operating    in   the    recommended    country   that   should    be   considered by the company.   Make your strategic recommendations for the company that   could   be useful in coping with those challenges.   (20   marks, 600 words   maximum)
Assignment Guidance Notes: 
The word limit for the overall assignment   is 3000 words.
Write a report addressing the assigned tasks. Use numbered headings and   subheadings   under   each task. All the figures, charts and tables should be numbered   and   titled,   and   they   should   be   referred to and used   in   the   report.
There should be no first-person references (I, we, us) in the report.      If self-reference is required,   you may refer to yourself as "the   author"   or   "this   report".
Assignments    require   you   to   demonstrate   that   you    understand,    and   you   are   able   to   apply theoretical concepts, models and frameworks, studied on the module, in   your analysis in the   report. Detailed descriptions of the frameworks that you use are not necessary.
This is a research-based assignment.   Your analytical discussion must be supported by relevant   sources of information (using   in-text citations).
Clarity   and   concision   are   encouraged   and   will   be   rewarded.   You   should   be   thorough   and   detailed   in your   analysis,   and   all the   points   should   be   fully   explained   and justified. You could present the discussions under each question    in the body of the r代 写SM9532 Strategic Frameworks and Cultural Contexts in International ManagementPython

The reports should have the   following   structure:
Cover page (with the module code, title, word count, your programme, and student   ID)
Table of contents (with   the   page   numbers)
Q1 
Q2 
Q3 
Q4 
List of references 
Appendices 
Appendices may be used only if   they are necessary to support your discussion. The appendices   should be properly organised and there should   be   in-text   references to   all   the   appendices.
The   work must be   word-processed and saved in PDF format for   final   submission. Line spacing 1.5, font size 12 and font type Arial should be   used   in the   body of the   report.
Do NOT mention your name, or tutor’s name anywhere on your   assignment.   Insert the page numbers and your student ID in the header or footer of every   page   of the   report.
Badly written, badly organised and/or badly presented work will   attract   a   low   grade.

General notes: 
If the assignment is within +10% of the word limit, no penalty will apply.
The word count is to be declared on   the   front   page   of   your   assignment   and   the   assignment   cover   sheet.    The word count does   not   include:
Title   and   Contents   page
List   of   References
Appendices
Appropriate   tables, figures, and   illustrations
Glossary
Bibliography
Quotes   from   interviews   and   focus   groups.
Please    note,    in    text    citations    [e.g.      (Smith,    2011)]      and      direct      secondary      quotations      [e.g.    “dib-dab nonsense analysis” (Smith, 2011 p.123)] are   INCLUDED   in the word   count.
If this word   count   is falsified,   students   are   reminded that   under ARTA   page   11   Section   1.13.2   this   will   be regarded as academic   misconduct.If the word limit of the full assignment exceeds the +10% limit, 10% of the total marks available for the assignment (i.e., 100 x 10% = 10) shall be deducted from the assignment mark.    For example:   An   assignment   which   would   have   scored   70%   but   that   has   a   word   count   greater   than   10%   of   the   prescribed word limit will be allocated 60%   (i.e.,   70   -10   =   60).
